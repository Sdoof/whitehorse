CBOT,ZC,corn,"Corn is the most widely produced feed grain in the United States, accounting for more than 90 percent of total production. Around 80 million acres of land are planted with corn. The majority of the crop is used as livestock feed; the remainder is processed into a multitude of food and industrial products including starch, sweeteners such as high fructose corn syrup, corn oil, and ethanol for use as a fuel. As corn prices rise, agricultural companies stand to benefit as their corn or corn seeds command a higher price in the market. Companies who buy corn or derivative products such as high fructose corn syrup can be hit with much larger costs when corn prices rise",http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/corn_contractSpecs_options.html?optionProductId=2730#optionProductId=2730,http://agnews.dtn.com/images/E0010035/CBOTLogoFull-Medium.jpg

In 1980 the U.S. it produced 60 percent of the world's soybeans, but by 2005 it produced only 39%. [2].Despite increased world supply, the price of soybean futures has increased more than 80% in 2008 because of soybean oil's use in biodiesel and as feed for fish farming. Another factor in soybeans' rise is China's urbanization, as Chinese cities buy large quantities of tofu and other soy products.

Wheat futures on Chicago's commodities exchange more than doubled in September 2007 compared to the previous year, going from $3.95 a bushel to nearly $9. What's driving up wheat prices is a matter of simple supply and demand, as bad weather, including a spate of hurricanes, have created shortages of this important grain.A more fundamental problem compounding the recent effects of bad weather is that farmers are increasingly switching to grow corn because of the skyrocketing demand for the ethanol-producing grain.",http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/kc-wheat_contract_specifications.html,http://agnews.dtn.com/images/E0010035/CBOTLogoFull-Medium.jpg

NYMEX,GC,gold,"Gold is one of the most highly-sought after precious metals in the world. It is used in jewelry, electronics, and coinage. Gold is widely considered to be an effective hedge against inflation, which means that when the dollar depreciates, demand for gold increases. In addition, during times of economic and political uncertainty, the demand for Gold rises due to its high intrinsic value and relative stability. Moreover, the introduction of gold ETFs and the increasing wealth in emerging markets, such as China, India, and Latin America have contributed to rising demand for gold. While demand for gold has been rising, supply has been dropping as many of the top gold producing countries have had decreasing production over the past few years.Gold has been used as money for more than 3,500 years as it doubles as a currency and a store of value. Gold is one of very few assets that is not the obligation of someone else.

Eventually, its popularity throughout the West gained it a reputation as the preferred drink of sultans and kings.If you're a coffee drinker, you can appreciate the effect that coffee can have on your body's chemistry. It has a similar chemical molecule makeup to adenosine, the fatigue molecule that your body produces. However, instead of adenosine bonding to tired cells, the caffeine in coffee is recognized by the cells and an entirely new chemical reaction occurs. The body ignores the adenosine and in a panic reaction, the brain releases adrenaline into the blood stream, creating a feeling of alertness and excitement that makes coffee a popular choice in overcoming fatigue.

With the development of sugar mills and refineries, sugar became a successful commodity in the Muslim world.In the 14th century, the Moors brought sugar growth and production to the Iberian Peninsula, and plantations were set up throughout what is now known as Spain and Portugal. These regions inherited the legacy of sugar manufacturing once the Moorish empire was successfully driven out of the Iberian Peninsula by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain. Eventually, Portugal successfully brought sugar to the New World, and by the 16th century there were more than 3,000 sugar mills throughout South America.The refined table sugar we consider a staple was once so rare and expensive that it was referred to as ""white gold."" Sugar cane, which was the first source of sugar, is a perennial grass that is grown in tropical and subtropical areas (before the arrival of sugar cane, honey and fruit were the only common sweeteners). Later, the development of an alternative source of sugar was discovered: beets. The sugar derived from these two sources is 99.8% pure sucrose, which is a complex sugar composed of glucose and fructose. Today, sugar can be found throughout the world, with over 120 countries successfully producing it for domestic and international use.

At the middle of 2009, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) had received 17 applications for combined construction and operating licenses (COL) for 26 new nuclear reactors.[2] Also, in June of 2009 there was evidence of growing U.S. government support; the Energy Department said it would invest $18.5 billion in federal loan guarantees to four U.S. firms to help build a new generation of nuclear reactors.",http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/other/uranium_contractSpecs_futures.html,
NYMEX,TT,cotton,"King Cotton has been around for thousands of years. Independently discovered in both the Old World and New World, no other commodity has created more controversy, built more nations, enriched more lives and caused more suffering. Extensively cultivated in India for 6,000 years, cotton became the darling of the British Empire via the Dutch East India Company during the 18th century.As slavery began to take root in the U.S., cheaper and heartier cotton from the South began to supplement and later replace Indian cotton. This coincided with Britain's desire to de-industrialize India's cotton industry and expand its own during the 19th century.",http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/softs/cotton.html,
NYMEX,AL,aluminum,"Aluminium or aluminum (in North American English) is a chemical element in the boron group with symbol Al and atomic number 13. It is a silvery-white, soft, nonmagnetic, ductile metal. Aluminium is the third most abundant element in the Earth's crust (after oxygen and silicon) and its most abundant metal. Aluminium makes up about 8% of the crust by mass, though it is less common in the mantle below. Aluminium metal is so chemically reactive that native specimens are rare and limited to extreme reducing environments. Instead, it is found combined in over 270 different minerals. The chief ore of aluminium is bauxite.",http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/aluminum_contractSpecs_futures.html,
NYMEX,QT,asian-palladium-futures,"Palladium is a chemical element with symbol Pd and atomic number 46. It is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by William Hyde Wollaston. He named it after the asteroid Pallas, which was itself named after the epithet of the Greek goddess Athena, acquired by her when she slew Pallas. Palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals (PGMs). These have similar chemical properties, but palladium has the lowest melting point and is the least dense of them.More than half the supply of palladium and its congener platinum is used in catalytic converters, which convert as much as 90% of the harmful gases in automobile exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) into less noxious substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor). Palladium is also used in electronics, dentistry, medicine, hydrogen purification, chemical applications, groundwater treatment, and jewelry. Palladium is a key component of fuel cells, which react hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity, heat, and water.",http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/platinum-palladium-spread_contractSpecs_options.html,
NYMEX,QR,asian-platinum-futures,"Platinum was a part of Native American culture before Columbus arrived in the New World. In 1557, Julius Caesar Scaliger writes about the metal, referencing the platinum mines of Panama and Mexico and the difficulty of melting the metal based on the technology of the times. Europeans realized early on that platinum was more precious than gold. King Louis XV of France acknowledged platinum's rarity and declared it the only metal fit for a king.During the 19th century, platinum was very difficult to metalsmith. It was often mixed with iridium in order to mold it into jewelry. Around the turn of the 20th century, Russia made several significant platinum deposit discoveries and began to produce 90% of the world's platinum. At the same time, advances in metalsmithing made the use of pure platinum more common.Platinum's metallic properties make it highly attractive in a variety of commercial and industrial applications. It has a high resistance to temperature and does not oxidize in air, although it is corroded by halogens, cyanides, sulfur and caustic alkalis. What's more, it is also non-reactive to chemical attack and has excellent electrical properties. (All that glitters isn't gold.

NYMEX,HG,copper-futures,"Copper is a metal that has been known all around the world since ancient times. From West Africa to China to Europe to Central and South America, copper has been mined and worked continuously from as far back as 8,700 BC. As one of the few independently occurring metals, copper has been used in a multitude of forms, from prehistoric pendants to modern-day piping and more.As a highly versatile material, copper can conduct electricity and is a necessary trace mineral in all living things. It also possesses the ability to destroy germs on contact. Copper is mined in large open pits, and Chile and the U.S. have extensive reserves that could be exhausted within the next 50 years. The New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), where copper contracts are traded, states that copper is the third most widely used metal in the world.",http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/copper_contractSpecs_futures.html,
NYMEX,QC,copper-miny-futures,"Copper is a chemical element with symbol Cu (from Latin: cuprum) and atomic number 29. It is a soft, malleable and ductile metal with very high thermal and electrical conductivity. A freshly exposed surface of pure copper has a reddish-orange color. It is used as a conductor of heat and electricity, as a building material and as a constituent of various metal alloys, such as sterling silver used in jewelry, cupronickel used to make marine hardware and coins and constantan used in strain gauges and thermocouples for temperature measurement.Copper is found as a pure metal in nature, and this was the first source of the metal to be used by humans, c. 8000 BC. It was the first metal to be smelted from its ore, c. 5000 BC, the first metal to be cast into a shape in a mold, c. 4000 BC and the first metal to be purposefully alloyed with another metal, tin, to create bronze, c. 3,500 BC.",http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/base/emini-copper_contractSpecs_futures.html,
NYMEX,QO,miny-gold-futures,"Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and the atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements, and is solid under standard conditions. The metal therefore occurs often in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).Gold's atomic number of 79 makes it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally in the universe. It is thought to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis and from the collision of neutron stars[4] and to have been present in the dust from which the Solar System formed. Because the Earth was molten when it was just formed, almost all of the gold present in the early Earth probably sank into the planetary core. Therefore, most of the gold that is present today in the Earth's crust and mantle is thought to have been delivered to Earth later, by asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment, about 4 billion years ago.",http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/e-mini-gold_contractSpecs_futures.html,
NYMEX,PA,palladium-futures,"Palladium is one of the rarest metals on earth, about 15 times more rare than platinum and 30 times more rare than gold. Belonging to the platinum group of metals, around 80% of the world's palladium production comes from two countries: Russia and South Africa. In fact, Russia alone accounts for roughly half of the world's production, which is estimated to be 200,000 ounces per year. This can create cause for concern as any decrease in exports from these countries can contribute to volatility in palladium prices.In comparison to platinum, palladium shares similar chemical properties but is less dense and has a lower melting point.",http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/palladium_contract_specifications.html?optionExpiration=U7,

NYMEX,QI,silver-miny-futures,"Silver is the metallic element with the atomic number 47. Its symbol is Ag, from the Latin argentum, derived from the Greek ὰργὀς (literally ""shiny"" or ""white""), and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European language root reconstructed as *h2erǵ-, ""grey"" or ""shining"". A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (""native silver""), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining.Silver has long been valued as a precious metal. Silver metal is used in many premodern monetary systems in bullion coins, sometimes alongside gold: while it is more abundant than gold, it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per-mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as ""0.940 fine"".

While logging had endured for centuries, it was not until World War I that standard lumber sizes were instituted. The significant amount of lumber that was required during World War II solidified the acceptance of standardized sizes because it provided an efficient way for mills and lumber purchasers to meet each other's needs while being separated by thousands of miles.Although lumber has many versatile uses, it is constantly subjected to changing consumer interests, shifts in manufacturing facilities and housing downturns. This leaves the industry in a constant state of panic because it is forced to be reactionary to various factors outside of its control. To protect the lumber industry from the volatile price swings that this uncertainty brings, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) developed the first lumber commodities contract in 1969.",http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/agricultural/grain-and-oilseed/oats_contractSpecs_options.html?optionProductId=2499#optionProductId=2499,
ICE,OJ,orange-juice-futures,"For 4,000 years, oranges have grown in Southeast Asia and China. The orange made its way to Europe during the Moorish occupation of Spain, eventually arriving in the New World. From these humble beginnings, a thriving orange industry has developed in both the U.S. and Brazil.Prior to 1947, the traditional form of consumption for orange juice was fresh-squeezed; therefore, the commercial orange juice industry was constantly contending with the highly perishable nature of freshly squeezed oranges. Often, supply shocks were both quick and severe. The invention of frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) in 1947 brought a new standard to the orange juice industry, opening the gates to an international marketplace that was not readily available before.Until 1962, Florida dominated the orange juice export market. However, because of severe freezes and hurricanes throughout the years, it has been overtaken by Brazil, the world's leading FCOJ exporter in 2009. In the last 30 years, Brazil's dominance in the international market has become so complete that it represents 80% of all global exports. Brazil even supplies the U.S. with 30-50% of its orange juice.",https://www.theice.com/products/30/specs,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/93/Ice_logo.svg/1024px-Ice_logo.svg.png
